# Create token-trickle site

## Init

Chose Vite and react-ts for this project `npm create vite@latest tokenTrickle -- --template react-ts`.

[I used Vite site to set this up.](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#trying-vite-online)
I chose Vite as I wanted to try it out, it has a very lean boiler plate, compared to NextJS or create-react-app.
