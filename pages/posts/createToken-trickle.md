# Create token-trickle site

Token Trickle will enable users to send Solana tokens to another users wallets overtime in a given rate, automatically.

## Init

Chose Vite and react-ts for this project `npm create vite@latest tokenTrickle -- --template react-ts`.

[I used Vite site to set this up.](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#trying-vite-online)
I chose Vite as I wanted to try it out, it has a very lean boiler plate, compared to NextJS or create-react-app.

## Adding Tailwind

I feel naked without some styling, and without a designer and a design template, I prefer to utilise Tailwinds premade styling guide.

[I used Tailwind site to set this up.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)

I styled the count button first to make sure Tailwind is installed properly.

## Adding the wallet

Here we are adding the wallet integration to the site.

This section is inspired by the wallet integration I have already done on the NFT section of this website. Its all open source on Github.

### NPM install dependencies

Run this long commad to install all the dependencies in one go.
`npm i @solana/wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`

### Copy Pasta my existed code

Didnt work, and I remembered where I got the example from had a TS version of the same code

### Copy pasta the documentation

[I copied the example in the Solana labs wallet adapter page exactly](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/)

This didnt work either

### Fixing Vite compability issues

Given that Vite is being lean it doesnt have many of the features that webpack has. First `global` was undefined, and because that is used by the wallet, app was crashing. Adding ...

```define: {
    global: {},
  },
```

... to the `vite.config.ts` file solved this problem.

Then the documentation was importing `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css` using `require`, which was again `undefined`. Converting this to a simple `import` solved this issue, and it all worked.

### Vite issues when building

Given that I have just vitnesed that the wallet adapter is not as easily compatible with Vite, I sensed that the build step is also probably going to have some issues. I rather solve these build issues earlier rather than later, as less code means there is less possible places the code can be broke form. I came across few issues so far:

1. **Some node modules librarys were not in TS:** So I modified the `tsconfig.json` file to by changing the `"skipLibCheck"` to false`false`

2. **[commonjs] Complex binding patterns require an initialization value:** This is pointing to a blockchain library that solana wallet adapter uses. Still not sure what the solution or the issue is ...

```
vite v2.8.6 building for production...
âœ“ 184 modules transformed.
[commonjs] Complex binding patterns require an initialization value (1:6) in /token-trickle/node_modules/@blocto/sdk/dist/blocto-sdk.module.js
file: /token-trickle/node_modules/@blocto/sdk/dist/blocto-sdk.module.js:1:6
1: var global$1 = (typeof global !== "undefined" ? global :
         ^
2:   typeof self !== "undefined" ? self :
3:   typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : {});
error during build:
SyntaxError: Complex binding patterns require an initialization value (1:6)

```

I believe the issue is similar to earlier where the [global][https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#global-objects] is not defined when using Vite because it is part of [Node's built in functions called Commonjs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules), unlike with webpack it is.

**What I have tried so far?**

1. Googled alot and clicked on pretty much every link, but it looks like not many people had this error before.
2. define `$global` like I defined `glonbal` in `vite.config.ts`
3. Deploy using Vercel, incase there is an issue wit my machine
4. Stack overflow is down
5. [Trying to provide custom build configuration now](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/blob/master/FAQ.md#babel--rollup--vite--snowpack--esbuild)
6. Tryed setting [`ignoreGLobal` flag](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs#ignoreglobal) in [vite config `build.commonjsOptions` ](https://vitejs.dev/config/#build-commonjsoptions)
7. Adding an alias to `"global$1" = "global"` in `vite.config.js`

**What fixed the build issue?**
Started researching in Vite issues. [This issue/solution helped me.](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/7257#issuecomment-1066064513). I had to update `define: { global: {}, }` to `define: { global: "globalThis", }`. Then the build managed to complete with no more errors.

Then when I tried to run the built project I got the error `ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined`, so back to drawing board ...

**What fixed the runing the built files issue?**

I realised this is another node built in feature that is not available in browser, just like global. So this is the same issue... I feel like there will be more of these issues when I start importing more packages.

I continued searching on vite issues, and [I tried using pre built version of the breaking package](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/5970), then tried few of the other node polyfill solutions I tried with the previous problem, but none worked.

Then [I installed buffer package, and added it to the entry point of the project](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/3126#discussioncomment-2349415) and built project started working fine
