# Solana hacker house - Prague

I have been following the Solana NFT ecosystem and communities for a few months. When I heard that there will be a Solana event in one of my favourite cities I had to attend. It was basically 100s of Solana enjoyers under one roof for 5 days. I didnt know what to expect before I went, but I was plesantly suprised at the amount of organisation went in to it. So thank you Solana, Rockaway and FTX for this event and one of the best weeks of my life.

I will try to break down the whole week in to categories below.

## The main venue

This hacker house took place in [paralelnipolis](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/). It is a crypto first caffe with hipster vibes and a hidden events centre at the back. The are is just outside the prague city centre, around 10 mins by tram. There were a lot of hotels and hostels, walking distance from the venue. which was very convenient. Around quarter of the people in the venue were just there to help faciliate the event. Like bouncers, waiters, cooks, baristas and the event organisers.

There were 2 rooms where there were monitors, ethernet cables and plugs, where people can hot desk to work on their project.
I went to this event alone so I got to speak to a ton of people in this hot desk set up. It was really cool to over hear people talking about tech in different languages. The stage room had load of neon lights and had a very cool atmosphere. 

The NFT galery is a bit smaller but there are more chill spots ther like couches, games and massage station. 

There was few more other rooms like the bar, a foyer, lobby and smoking area, where people chilled, worked and networked.  


## Development

Speaking to many people in the event I came to a conclusion that I should switch my attention from NFTs to DeFi. My goal for the next few weeks is to learn what all the key words mean and start making small investments to see how different methods work. 

Also speaking to many teams devs and investors I realised that there is a shortage of Solana backend developers. We need Rust language to create smart contracts in Solana. There is no shortage of javascript developers, as this is a very common language, but still the demand is very high for them.

I realised for backend I need to learn Rust with Anchor frame work. I have started learning this in the last 2 days of the hackathon.

For front end, the most in demand skills are React with NextJS with solana library for Javascript. To get familiar with the Solana libraries I created the NFTs page in this website to learn more about how to fetch data from Solana chain and how to connect a wallet to my site. I have created this in the first 2 days of the hackathon.

One of the benefits of working here was that, pretty much everyone uses the same tech stack, so if I ever got stuck I could always ask someone random next to me and we could solve the issue together.  
 
## Networking

This was very special event for networking. Many like minded people who share a common interest were all under one roof. 
Every one was very friendly and always happy to introduce them selves and talk about their projects.

## Food and Drink

One of the highlights of the week was the amazing food and drinks I got to consume. It was expecially good so we don't have to go out and hunt for food and spend more time building, networking and exchanging ideas. 

There was a bar with unlimited soft drinks and caffeine all day and unlimited alcohol from afternoon. All for free.
Breakfast nibbles at the bar and open buffet food was available for lunch and dinner, which was all local high quality and tastiy food. And again all for free. 

Also in the 3 partys we attended, there again unlimitied free food and alcohol. I tried caviar for the first time in one of these events.
