# Solana hacker house - Prague

I have been following the Solana NFT ecosystem and communities for a few months. When I heard there would be a Solana event in one of my favourite cities, I had to attend. It was basically 100s of Solana enjoyers under one roof for 5 days. I didn't know what to expect before I went, but I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of organisation that went into it. So thank you, Solana, Rockaway and FTX, for this event and one of the best weeks of my life.

I will try to break down the whole week into categories below.

## The main venue

This hacker house took place in [paralelnipolis](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/). It is a crypto first cafe with hipster vibes and a hidden events centre at the back. The venue is just outside the Prague city centre, around 10 mins by tram. There were a lot of hotels and hostels, walking distance from the venue, which was very convenient. Around a quarter of the people in the venue were just there to help facilitate the event. Like bouncers, waiters, cooks, baristas and event organisers.

There were 2 rooms with monitors, ethernet cables and plugs, where people can hot desk to work on their project.
I went to this event alone, so I got to speak to many people in this hot desk set-up. It was really cool to overhear people talking about tech in different languages. The stage room had a load of neon lights, deep house playing. 

The NFT gallery is a bit smaller, but there are more chill spots like couches, games and massage stations. 

There were a few other rooms like the bar, a foyer, lobby and smoking area, where people chilled, worked, and networked.  


## Development

Speaking to many people in the event, I concluded that I should switch my attention from NFTs to Defi. For the next few weeks, my goal is to learn what all the keywords mean and start making small investments to see how different methods work. 

Also, speaking to many teams of devs and investors, I realised a shortage of Solana backend developers. We need Rust language to create smart contracts in Solana. There is no shortage of javascript developers, as this is a widespread language. However, still, the demand is very high for them.

I realised that I need to learn Rust with the Anchor framework for the backend. I have started learning this in the last 2 days of the hackathon.

For the front end, the most in-demand skills are React with NextJS with Solana library for Javascript. To get familiar with the Solana libraries, I created the NFTs page on this website to learn more about how to fetch data from the Solana chain and connect a wallet to my site. I have made this in the first 2 days of the hackathon.

One of the benefits of working here was that everyone uses the same tech stack. If I ever got stuck, I could always ask someone random next to me, and we could solve the issue together.  
 
## Networking

This was very special event for networking. Many like-minded people who share a common interest were all under one roof. 
Everyone was very friendly and always happy to introduce themselves and talk about their projects.

## Food and Drink

One of the week's highlights was the fantastic food and drinks I got to consume. It was especially good so we didn't have to go out and hunt for food and spend more time building, networking and exchanging ideas. 

There was a bar with unlimited soft drinks and caffeine all day and alcohol from the afternoon, acting as a catalyst for networking.
Breakfast nibbles at the bar and open buffet food were available for lunch and dinner, all local high quality and tastiy food. And again all for free. 

Also in the 3 partys we attended, there again unlimitied free food and alcohol. I tried caviar for the first time in one of these events.
