# Chad

Hey, I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.perlego.com/" target="_blank">Perlego</a> with a passion for tech for good and blockchain.

> Programming for 4+ years has taught me how much I don't know about programming.

I like hanging out in Solana NFT communities and going to the gym.

## Professional

I have always worked as a software developer.
During covid lockdowns, I attempted to create a customs declaration SaaS business and learned a lot.

### Perlego

I have been a member of this family for over a year now, and it is my favourite workplace ever. Showcasing my Next JS skills during my interview was one of the big reasons I got hired.
I made significant contributions to the creation of <a href="https://www.perlego.com/book/3042820/nfts-for-dummies-pdf" target="_blank">the logged out Book pages of Perlego</a> , which we created using NextJS.
After we delivered the MVP, I created microservices to return the recommendations you see at the bottom of the book page.
Then I became the tech lead of my team of devs, delivered two fullstack projects, and am now working on a long epic now.

### Agile Import.

Set up a company to help UK traders make customs declarations after Brexit.

- I created <a href="https://www.agileimport.co.uk/" target="_blank">this landing page</a> with NextJS and TailwindCSS and
  <a href="https://github.com/Agile-Import/marketing" target="_blank">
    its repo here
  </a>
- I Created <a href="http://calcofduty.co.uk" target="_blank">this UK import duty calculator</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WaterlessPiano2/Duty" target="_blank">its repo here</a>..
- Behind the scenes I attempted to create the core product and learned how to use Formik and Yup to generate forms from JSON.

[Here are more details about what I got up to at Agile Import](/posts/agileImport).
